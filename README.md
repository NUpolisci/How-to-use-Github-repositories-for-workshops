# How-to-use-Github-repositories-for-workshops
This repository is for students who do not know how to access files in github repositories

## Overview of Github
Github is essentially like 'Dropbox', 'Google Drive', 'Box', etc... It is a ways to manage versions of files, including R scripts, between collaborators and your past and furture selves. Rather than having each departmental workshop run out of different folders via 'Dropbox', 'Google Drive', 'Box', etc... we can put it all onto Github. This makes it simple for accessing the latest versions of all workshops, as well as previous workshops.
